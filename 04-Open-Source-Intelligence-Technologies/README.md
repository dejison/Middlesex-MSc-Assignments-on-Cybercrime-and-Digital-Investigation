OSINT investigation of fictitious target using Maltego Classic, Paterva, etc.
All personal identifiers removed or blurred.

## Project Overview

This repository presents an academic Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) case study examining the collapse of FTX Trading Ltd.  
The project applies structured OSINT methodology to analyse publicly available information surrounding one of the most significant failures in cryptocurrency history.

The work was completed as part of an academic portfolio and is intended to demonstrate investigative reasoning, ethical handling of data, and analytical reporting.

## Objectives

The objectives of this case study are to:

- Apply OSINT techniques to a real-world cryptocurrency collapse
- Identify key events, actors, and timelines using public sources
- Demonstrate ethical data handling under UK GDPR
- Produce a clear, evidence-based analytical narrative
- Present findings suitable for academic and professional review


## Scope & Limitations

### In Scope
- Publicly available news reporting
- Regulatory and court filings
- Official statements and timelines
- Public blockchain and financial reporting commentary

### Out of Scope
- Speculative or unverified claims
- Leaked or non-public data
- Private communications
- Technical blockchain forensics requiring privileged datasets

This project focuses on **analysis**, not accusation or enforcement.

## Methodology

The investigation followed a structured OSINT workflow:

1. Source identification and validation
2. Timeline reconstruction
3. Cross-referencing of multiple independent sources
4. Analytical synthesis of findings
5. Ethical review and redaction
6. Academic reporting and presentation

All sources were assessed for credibility, relevance, and potential bias.

## Key Findings (Summary)

- The collapse of FTX was driven by a combination of governance failures, liquidity mismanagement, and inadequate risk controls.
- Public information revealed significant discrepancies between public assurances and operational realities.
- Regulatory oversight gaps and organisational opacity contributed to delayed detection.
- OSINT analysis proved effective in reconstructing timelines without access to privileged data.
