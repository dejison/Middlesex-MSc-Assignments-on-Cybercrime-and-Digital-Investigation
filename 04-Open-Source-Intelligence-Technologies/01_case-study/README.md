## Risk and Incident Analysis Perspective

From a risk and incident management perspective, the FTX collapse highlights
systemic governance, liquidity, and oversight failures that escalated into
a major organisational incident.

Key considerations include:
- Breakdown of internal controls and risk segregation
- Delayed detection despite public warning indicators
- Challenges of incident response in decentralised financial ecosystems
- Importance of early risk indicators in preventing systemic failure
