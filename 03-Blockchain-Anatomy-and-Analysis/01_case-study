## Methodology Overview

The analysis followed a structured approach:

1. Identification of relevant blockchain transactions
2. Breakdown of transaction anatomy (inputs, outputs, fees, timestamps)
3. Examination of transaction flow and wallet interactions
4. Visual and tabular representation of findings
5. Interpretation of patterns within an academic context


## Risk and Incident Analysis Perspective

From a risk and incident analysis perspective, this project highlights:

- How transaction transparency enables traceability
- Limitations of pseudonymity in preventing analysis
- Challenges in attribution without off-chain intelligence
- Importance of ethical boundaries in blockchain investigations


## Academic Integrity Statement

This repository represents original academic work.
All analysis is based on publicly accessible blockchain data
and is presented for educational purposes only.
