# Blockchain Anatomy & Analysis
Traced Bitcoin transactions from the dark-market seizure dataset.
All real addresses anonymised; visualised using an open-source blockchain explorer.



## Academic Context

This repository presents an academic cryptocurrency and blockchain investigation conducted using open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques. The project demonstrates analytical methodology, evidential reasoning, and forensic limitations in blockchain-based investigations. It does not constitute legal findings, allegations, or real-world attribution.

## Learning Outcomes Demonstrated

This project demonstrates the following blockchain analysis learning outcomes:

- Understanding of blockchain architecture and transaction structure
- Analysis of on-chain transaction data and metadata
- Identification of wallet interactions and transaction flows
- Interpretation of blockchain transparency and pseudonymity
- Application of analytical reasoning to decentralised systems
- Ethical handling and presentation of blockchain-derived data

## Tools and Standards Referenced

**Blockchain Platforms**
- Bitcoin

**Analysis Tools**
- Blockchain explorers (e.g. Blockchain.com)
- Transaction visualisation and tracing tools
- Spreadsheet and data analysis techniques

**Standards and Principles**
- Blockchain transparency and immutability
- Pseudonymity and address-based analysis
- Ethical use of publicly available ledger data

## Scope and Limitations

This analysis is limited to publicly available blockchain data
and does not involve private keys, off-chain data, or identity attribution.

Wallet addresses are treated as pseudonymous identifiers and
are analysed only in terms of observable transaction behaviour.
